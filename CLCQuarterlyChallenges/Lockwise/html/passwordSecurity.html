                        <p>
                            Strong passwords are of the utmost importance. They protect your electronic accounts and devices from unauthorized access, keeping your sensitive personal information safe. The more complex the password, the more protected your information will be from cyber threats and hackers. So how can you make sure the passwords you use don’t jeopardize your security? Here are some tips on creating a secure password that can help safeguard your information.
                            The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Use two-factor authentication (2FA) - 2FA is an additional security measure that requires you to provide more information than your password alone. This can be an assigned personal identification number (PIN), a code sent to your email or mobile phone, or a fingerprint or voiceprint. Though not available across all accounts and devices, you should use 2FA whenever possible to further protect your information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Incorporate numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters - Hackers use programs that cycle the most common, simplest passwords used. Because of this, your password should include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to increase its complexity. The more complex the password, the safer it is.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure your password is at least eight characters in length - Sometimes, hackers use a brute force method to gain access to your accounts and devices. However, the longer your password is, the less likely it is for this cyber threat to occur. Complex, lengthy passwords take too much time to hack—so cyberterrorists are less likely to target these.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use an abbreviated phrase or saying for your password - Choosing a password that’s easy to remember makes sense, and often can be done safely. Pick a phrase that’s memorable to you, and then create a secure password around it. For instance, the phrase “cup of joe” could be abbreviated to (uP!0F*J03#.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Change your password regularly - The longer you use the same password, the greater the risk that it will become compromised. Update all your account and device passwords periodically and be sure that the new password is totally different from the original. Recycling old passwords increases the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.

                    <p>
                        We're often told that the passwords for our online accounts should be really strong, and to not use the same password anywhere else. Especially for those important accounts like email, banking, shopping and social media. The trouble is, most of us have lots of online accounts, so creating different passwords for all of them (and remembering them) is hard. This is where a password manager can help. A password manager (or a web browser) can store all your passwords securely, so you don’t have to worry about remembering them. This allows you to use unique, strong passwords for all your important account, rather than using the same password for all of them, which you should never do.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some good password managers to consider to store your passwords: Keypass, Bitwarden, 1Password and Dashlane.</p>
